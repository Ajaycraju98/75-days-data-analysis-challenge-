Day_22: Creating & Sharing Power BI Reports
Creating and sharing Power BI reports allows organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights and make those insights accessible to a wide audience. Through Power BI Desktop, users can connect to diverse data sources, clean and model the data, and design interactive, visually appealing reports. Sharing options in Power BI Service enable users to distribute reports to team members or external stakeholders, whether through direct sharing, embedding in applications, or exporting for non-interactive use.
