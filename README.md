Day_22: Creating & Sharing Power BI Reports
Creating and sharing Power BI reports allows organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights and make those insights accessible to a wide audience. Through Power BI Desktop, users can connect to diverse data sources, clean and model the data, and design interactive, visually appealing reports.
