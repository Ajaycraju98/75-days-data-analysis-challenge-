Day_22: Creating & Sharing Power BI Reports
Creating and sharing Power BI reports allows organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights and make those insights accessible to a wide audience. Through Power BI Desktop, users can connect to diverse data sources, clean and model the data, and design interactive, visually appealing reports. Sharing options in Power BI Service enable users to distribute reports to team members or external stakeholders, whether through direct sharing, embedding in applications, or exporting for non-interactive use.
Day_23 : Power BI's Q&A feature for natural language queries
Power BIâ€™s Q&A feature brings a new level of accessibility and efficiency to data analysis by allowing users to query data in plain language. This tool empowers users, regardless of their technical background, to gain insights quickly and visually without the need for complex coding or extensive training. By streamlining data exploration through suggestions, automatic visualizations, and customization options, Q&A enhances the interactivity and flexibility of Power BI reports, making it easier for businesses to make data-driven decisions in real-time.
Day_24 : Using custom visuals in Power BI
In Power BI, custom visuals allow you to create more dynamic and tailored visualizations beyond the default visuals available in the platform. These can be particularly useful if you have unique data presentation needs or want to explore advanced visuals. Using custom visuals in Power BI enhances the storytelling capabilities of data reports by providing flexibility and tailored visualizations. Custom visuals enable users to create unique representations that suit specific data analysis needs, making complex data insights more accessible and engaging. They expand beyond standard visuals, offering innovative ways to display data that can be interactive, visually appealing, and highly customized.
